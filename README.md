# Mint and list color NFTs

Boilerplate project for minting and listing color NFT tokens. The color can be replaced with complex JSON data structures.

## Installing

You need hardhat: https://hardhat.org/

In the root directory and the frontend directory execute "npm install".

## Next steps

~~Rewrite the ui with tailwind CSS.~~

Add light/dark mode switch.

~~Add token rights management: only the issuer of the contract should be allowed to mint new tokens. Other rules could be defined.~~

~~Add send NFT functionality.~~

Replace the color attribute of the NFTs with a more complex data structure and possible external data.
